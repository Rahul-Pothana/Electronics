**RS-485 Communication Protocol: Robust and Reliable for Long-Distance Connectivity**
This repo helps you to understand how to use RS-485 using two pi pico w microcontrollers
**Overview**
RS-485 stands out as one of the most dependable communication protocols, particularly for scenarios requiring data transmission over extended distances. You might be wondering where it will be useful for you, RS-485 becomes crucial when your microcontroller is situated far from its associated peripherals (example: sensors/display/motors) , spanning distances up to 1 km or so (ideally 12000 meters). In such cases, the limitations of conventional communication protocols like SPI, I2C, or UART become evident due to potential data loss and wireless communication might not be cost effiecient for small projects.


**Code Usage**

Setup requires two devices are involved: one functions as the transmitter (TX), and the other as the receiver (RX).

Implementation
To integrate RS-485 into your project, employ modules such as MAX485 to facilitate the conversion of RS-485 data, thhis allows your microcontroller to communicate. Additionally, you can use RS485 to TTL converter modules for bidirectional communication with serial communication tools like Docklight.
